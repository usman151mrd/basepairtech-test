# Exercise 02 - REST API #

Requirements:
- Setup a simple Django REST API application.
- Create a model called "Series" that contains the following fields:
  - name: char(40)
  - data: json field
- Add an endpoint to retrieve all the Series' records from the database
- The endpoint should allow you to filter records by the name
- Populate the table with 3 records:

Name: Score 1
Data: [10, 15, 8, 15, 32]

Name: Score 2
Data: [8, 12, 16, 10, 2]

Name: Score 3
Data: [11, 24, 9, 9, 13]

# What will be evaluated #
