# Exercise 05 - Static visualization #

Requirements:
We ordered a new wireless router to improve the Internet reliability. While everybody feels that the new router is better, we want to be data driven. We ran 20 pings with the old and new routers. The data is attached in files `old-router.txt` and `new-router.txt`. Create a figure with this data to convince someone if the new router is better than the old one.

# What will be evaluated #
- The solution approach.
- The design pattern used to architect the solution.
- The quality of the code.
Note: Working solution will have an extra consideration.
